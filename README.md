# SunScreenSite

For our biohack project we created a sunscreen site that would tell users the ideal SPF for their location. 
Darrien Gunn and Luis Sanchez worked heavily on the back-end while Samantha Vuong worked on the front-end.
Using text editors such as sublime and incubators like netbeans we combined our work to make our website.
We linked an api to our site which would return the UV value of the corresponding location
